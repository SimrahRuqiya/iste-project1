            <p>Back before the 1970s, Dubai had been a barren desert that has been transformed into a city from the dreams of our dear Rulers. It exudes an alluring aura that reigns in plenty of visitors and potential investors. It is open to any and all cultures and invites all to share their tradition and culture. There are even areas within UAE that invite all to come and learn about each other. You may learn about Emirati heritage, Lebanese, Iraqi, or even the Russians and Chinese.</p><br>
            <p>Throughout the year, the city celebrates many festivals and holidays with historical ties to their respective religions and cultures such as: New Year, Islamic New Year, Lunar New Year, Diwali, Eid al Fitr, Eid al Adha, Halloween, Christmas, etc. Therefore the residents host several days of festivities and showcase their cuisine and music. For the adventurous, they can book a guide to explore the desert, skydive above the city, or even ride the world's longest zipline at Jebel Hafeet or prehaps dine at the top of Jebel Jais.</p><br>
            <p>As we have mentioned before, there is a multitude of activities and entertainment for residents and visitors alike to explore. Please check out our other pages to plan a surprise itinerary for yourself, your family, or friends. We have handpicked handful of restaurants that we would like to recommend to those willing to tackle different cuisines.</p>
